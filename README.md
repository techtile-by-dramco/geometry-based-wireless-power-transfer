# Experiment Geometry Based RF Wireless Power Transfer

clo = cable length offset

- Four USRPs are synchronized using the reference signal applied to the RX port of channel 0.
- **HERE THERE ARE ADDITIONAL PHASE OFFSETS BETWEEN THE REFERENCE SIGNALS**
- The RX/TX port of channel 1 is connected to the oscilloscope.
- A total of 100 iterations are performed.
- During each synchronization cycle, the oscilloscope measures the phase relationship of channels 2, 3, and 4 with respect to channel 1.
- The build-in measurement functie is used to measure the phases.
- To prevent incorrect phase results, additional **phase offsets** were added: T05: 0°, T06: 45°, T07: 90°, and T08: 135°.

⚠️⚠️⚠️ To make this work, it is essential that the phase differences between the reference cables are measured with respect to one common reference, and then applied in the following way: CH2 − CH1, CH3 − CH1, CH4 − CH1. ⚠️⚠️⚠️

| Channels     | Mean                 | Std                  |
|--------------|----------------------|-----------------------|
| CH1 - CH2    | 0.5744586887005192   | 0.9478001175555331    |
| CH1 - CH3    | 7.081923336931293    | 0.9869667338113204    |
| CH1 - CH4    | 7.959343748393683    | 0.9218934521364133    |

### Conclusion

We can again observe that the outputs of the 2-way splitters exhibit a very good phase relationship. 
As a result, the phase relationship between CH1–CH2 and CH3–CH4 yields very good results. 
Consequently, CH1–CH3, CH1–CH4, CH2–CH3, and CH2–CH4 produce less accurate results.

⚠️ Here, the phase was always measured relative to CH1, in the following way: CH2 − CH1, CH2 − CH1, CH3 − CH1.
